									What if you want to know as a business, how your product is getting a response from
									customers? Is it positive, in other words, is your product popular among consumers
									or negative and people didn’t like the product? Or, you are curious to know what is
									happening around you but you don’t know where to go. Here comes Opinion Miner, a
									tool that shows trends and does sentiment analysis on any word or topic in general.
									You just have to type a word and the tool will let you know whether the entered word
									has a positive response from people or negative based on the data from twitter. The
									tool uses twitter API to get a live feed, does analysis in real-time, and shows it
									to the user. Apart from this, it also shows visibility, an important parameter used
									to analyze data. In simple terms, visibility means a user with more followers will
									have more weight towards the whole analysis as compared to the one with fewer
									followers. For more details visit <a

										Miner</a>.

									Opinion Miner is a fully functional dashboard that welcomes the user by showing the
									trending hashtags from twitter which are sorted country wise. And it also has a
									search bar to search for any particular word of user’s choice. Once a user chooses a
									word to analyze, the dashboard shows the following information regarding the word
									user has searched.

										<span class="sub-part">

									<span>CI/CD Pipeline</span>
								</div>
								The project is deployed on AWS using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. The Github is
								used for Continuous Integration and combination of Docker and Jenkins are used for
								Continuous Deployment.

								<ol>
									<li>New changes are commited to Github</li>
									<li>Github triggers a webhook sending a post request to Jenkins about the changes
									</li>
									<li>Jenkins starts first pipeline which fetches all changes from Github and builds a
										docker image</li>
									<li>Once the first pipeline gets completed, it triggers second pipeline which uses
										the `docker image` built during first pipeline and runs a container along with
										removing the older one and now new changes are live</li>
