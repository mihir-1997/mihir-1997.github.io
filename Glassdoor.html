                                    Glassdoor Prototype is a clone of real Glassdoor web application where current and
                                    former employees add reviews/photos of companies. It also allows us to create job
                                    alerts by asking interesting industry to its users. The application has three
                                    entities,

                                        <strong>User: </strong>A User can apply to different jobs at different companies
                                        with a resume and cover letter attached and check the status of the application
                                        at any time. He can update his profile by adding/updating past experience,
                                        education, and skills. Users can contribute by adding reviews/photos/interview
                                        experiences of their previous companies anonymously.

                                        <strong>Employer: </strong>An employer is the one who posts jobs for his
                                        company. He can see an overall impression of his company through matrices like
                                        overall ratings, interview experience, CEO approval from employees, and whether
                                        the employee would recommend this company to a friend or not.

                                        <strong>Admin: </strong>This is the administration account of Glassdoor and is
                                        responsible for filtering out inappropriate reviews and photos added by users.
                                        If the admin approves the review/photo then only it can be made publicly
                                        available. One of the major features for admin is the dashboard which shows no
                                        of reviews per day, top 5 users with highest approved reviews, top 10 CEOs based
                                        on ratings, etc.
